This Repository has some sample codes like below.
- `@RestController` and the test codes with using MvcMock.

## How to run on your local ?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change directory to cloned one.
3. Run `mvn install`. Run `brew install maven` or install maven if your env doesn't have maven.
4. Run `mvn spring-boot:run`
